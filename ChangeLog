  + hbide/hbide_v.ch
    + Readded: the header containing latest revision number.
       This is done because otherwise HbIDE cannot be built by a 
       user who has not properly set QtContribs build environment,
       which, along other things, require subversion client installed
       on his machine. Mostly it will never be required for average user 
       but just in case...

       NOTE: this will always publish one revision less than the current 
             in HbIDE title-bar.

  + hbide/qtcore.txt
  + hbide/qtgui.txt
  + hbide/qtnetwork.txt
    + Added: not-on-qt-sources dependent functions list of HbQt modules.
       Has been a constant source of building HbIDE on folders which 
       are not in synch with HbQt folder locations.

  * hbide/dict.prg
  * hbide/main.prg
  * hbide/saveload.prg
    % Fixed: regression about duplicated CASE constants in SWITCH statement.

2012-10-08 01:24 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbxbp/generic.prg
    % Changed: one SWICH statement to DO CASE because Xbase++ defines 
      two alignment constants to "0" until I resolve this issue.

2012-10-07 17:01 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbxbp/appevent.prg
    ! Fix to prev fix.

2012-10-07 16:59 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbxbp/appevent.prg
    ! Fixed: commented-out duplicate key values generated by Xbase++
       for some xbeK_CTRL_* contstants.

2012-10-07 16:06 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbxbp/xbp.ch
    ! Fixed: some wrong constants.
       Thanks Przemek for introducing duplicate case constants compile 
       time check which could detect these type of error, something 
       rare to debug otherwise.

2012-10-07 15:34 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: the version guard agaisnt which a class is compiled.
       Earlier every class was guarded against v4.5.
       Now class is guarded against minimum of v4.5 or defined for 
       a class in .qth in CLASS section. 
         <CLASS> 
         ...
         Version = 0x040n00 
         </CLASS>
 
       This empowers HbQt engine to add any class comes with new version 
       of Qt.

2012-10-06 02:23 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * qtcontribs.hbp
    + Added: SVN properties.
       May be absense of these was responsible to behave erratically on Linux.

2012-10-05 17:37 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbide/main.prg
    + Enabled: Codepage UTF-8 by default. 

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_init.cpp
    ! Fixed: a nasty implementation belonging to UTF-8 codepage.
       "UTF8" => "UTF-8" 
       This caused unnecessary noise in the past.

2012-10-05 16:32 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)

    - Deleted: header to fetch SVN revision no. 

  * hbide/hbide.hbp
    + Added: -vcshead=hbide_v.ch
       This generates the hbide_v.ch at build time and is included in 
       main.prg and misc.prg.
    ; TODO: one common function to pull this info than at two places.

2012-10-05 12:09 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)

    5 Changed: Statics to locals.

2012-10-04 17:22 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    + Added: hbqt_bindAddConnected(), hbqt_bindDelConnected() functions.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_misc.prg
    + Added: class HbQtConnecteds().

    IMPLEMENTED: the objects having any signal connected to remain alive 
                 irrespective of the Harbour variable scope. Uptil now 
                 a :connect() to be functional, the variable holding the 
                 object had to remain in scope till the life of that 
                 connect's life-span. Now it is not needed. Below is

    % Optimizations.
    + Implemented: concept of manageable tool-box containing almost 
       entire set of actions spread across menus and toolbars. This 
       tiny toolbox can be called with Ctrl+M and appears right near 
       the editing cursor position. The interface to manage this toolbox
       is underway, which beside other things, will facilitate to 
       configure it visually as to which icons, at what position:row-col,
       should appear. The goal is to allow users to hide all toolbars from 
       applications window and call this toolbox whenever there is a need.
       A work-in-progress. But the toolbox is functional with Ctrl+M.

  * hbide/projectwizard.prg

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    % Optimization leading to proper object destruction on Qt level,
       in certain cases. This optimization has no visible impact, but 
       certainly improves memory consumption in applications which
