  * hbide/main.prg
    ! Fixed: Double-click on a node in Project Tree representing source
       file with relative path was not being opened. Thanks to 
       Gregory Shashkoff for the report and exact explanation.

2013-01-18 18:51 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    ! Fixed: to properly pass "Launch Parameters" of "Propereties" dialog 
       while launching the application. A long standing bug.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: :showIndicator( cRgbColorString )
       Places a 2 pixel high line with <cRgbColorString> on top of the 
       browser window. This facilitates the place a warning system on the 
       tables having utmost sensivity.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
    + Made public some attributes of the MdiBrowser, i.e., :connection(), :driver().

  * hbdbu/dbu.prg
    + Added code to show a RED line on top of the browser if a table is opened 
       via a specific connection.

    + Initial commit of HbDBU.
       Just play with this toy. Do not initiate embedding HbQtDbu() 
       in your applications as refinement in internal architect is 
       on the cards. Some details are scheduled to be changed.

    ; Note that the HbDBU contains all elements which I am employing 
       for our in-production implementation but guarded against the 
       directives. You can unfold them as you deem fit. The real-time 
       usage is always preferred to expose the full functionality 
       than a reduced demo application, so hope that you will bear 
       with me.

       The detailed documentation will follow after internal architect 
       will reach my satisfaction level. Next couple of weeks I am 
       onto this only. 

       If you deem appropriate, extend your opinions and experiences 
       of any DBU you had been living with. Hopefully maximum will 
       make-up inside HbDBU.

    ; Enjoy with the multi-platform compliant HbDBU.

  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtdbu.prg
  + hbqtwidgets/hbqttoolbar.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: Class HbQtToolbar() and HbQtDbu().
       The last week has been so hectic but results are very fruitful.
       HbQtDbu() is a COM like implementation of GUI Database Manager 
       which can be embedded into any application. All its components 
       are fully configurable. A detailed overview and a usable and 
       expandable application will be committed in a couple of days.

    ; You will really relish this implementation.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
  + hbqtwidgets/resources/help.png
    + Added: help.png.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Fixed: flickering of windows when <Search> was initiated.
    + Added: <Help> icon on the toolbar.
    + Started: implementation of displaying appln supplied help info 
       in an integrated way. Currently Alert() is being used but 
       is scheduled to be presented in a meaningful way. Complete 
       documentation will follow after it reaches a satisfactory level.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: code to show a help alert when <Help> icon is clicked.

2013-01-11 18:51 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtalert.prg
    ! Fixed: text rendering was not don with monospace font.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    % Changed: ACCESS|ASSIGN MESSAGE editable() => editEnabled()
    + Added: ACCESS|ASSIGN MESSAGE columnsComboEnabled( lEnabled )
       This hides the <toColumn> combobox on the browser toolbar.
    + Added: ACCESS|ASSIGN MESSAGE printingEnabled( lEnabled )
       This hides the <Print> toolbar button.

    ; NOTE: the above switches are operational on toolbar actions.
       From withing application all actions are available.

    % Rearranged: toolbar icons sequence. Now it is more usable.

    ! Fixed: <Search> variable was not sent to appln callback in 
       trimmed state causing to fail the serach on character columns.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browser.prg
    % Some adjustments.

2013-01-11 02:01 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/resources/stop.png
    % Changed: <Stop> icon image.

2013-01-09 18:47 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtevent.prg
    + Added: function __hbqtKeyboard( <ncKey>, [<oWidget>] )
       Posts <ncKey> into <oWidget>'s event queue. 
       <oWidget> defaults to QApplication():focusWidget().
        The function provides a convinient mechanism to initiate another 
        action from with current action after returning from current 
        action. This protocol is the backbone of any GUI application.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: public method :widget() which returns the main component 
       of browser and can be used to post events. This is :oTableView in HbQtBrowse().

    + Added: ACESS/ASSIGN METHOD searchText( <cSearchText> ).
       This displays <cSearchText> at the right side of statusbar 
       of browser widget. this is a convinient method to avoid creation of 
       widget to display user-input. ( Read below ).

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate how INCREMENTAL search can be terminated from 
       withing appln :navigationBlock.
    
    + Added: code to demonstrate how an incremental search can be performed 
       taking use of oBrowse:searchText() method and how to take other actions
       while still in incremental search.

2013-01-09 14:49 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: class constructor from "NEW" to "INIT".
       This is in-line with Class(y) compatibility and will be useful 
       when Przemek will implement true objects in Harbour. 
       Though it will not be necessary at this moment, but still 
       re-build everything.

  * hbqt/qtcore/qth/QCoreApplication.qth
    % Detached: 2nd paarmeter of :postEvent() to use just like on stack object.

  + hbqtwidgets/resources/stop.png
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
    + Added: stop.png.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Fixed: wrong implemention of sending :selectAll() to QLineEdit.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    % Experimented: but failed, code still resides.
   
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    - Deactivated: moving the columns with mouse. Will come to it later.
    + Added: <Stop> browser toolbar icon adjoining <Scroll>.
       The icon remains in disabled state until a <Scroll> is initiated.
       Once clicked, its state is again disabled.

    % Removed: the <Stop> button appearing at the bottom row after <Scroll> 
       is initiated. Now toolbar icon <Stop> is enabled instead.

      <Scroll> event is now terminated if any other event is initiated.
      This is necessary to avoid multiple initializations leading to 
      weired behavior.

    + Enhanced: oBrowse:editCell( cPicture, cColor, bWhen, bValid, nKey )
       <nKey> is the key you would like to stuff in the edit buffer.
       This implementation respects "@K" function of <cPicture> parameter 
       or oColumn:picture clause is <cPicture> is not passed to :editCell().

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: code to demonstrate how "@K " in oBrowse:editCell() can be exploited.

2013-01-08 19:36 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  + hbqtwidgets/scroll.ui
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: scroll.ui - Widget to fetch user options for a scroll.

  + hbqtwidgets/resources/scroll.png
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
    + Added: scroll.png.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    % :selectAll() was wrongly called on other type of GET then QLineEdit.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: appln callable method :scroll( [<nMode>], [<nMSInterval>] )
             Interface icon <Scroll> on the browser toolbar which call :scroll().
       
       This is a convinient mechanism to to present table with auto 
       scroll option where data is refreshed in a fixed interval. It is a 
       most useful function for upper management to provide a dash-board 
       like functionality. 

       If :scroll() is called without any parameter, then a dialog to 
       fetch user options is presented, otherwise scroll is initiated 
       immediately.

       <nMode> has three possible values:
       1. Scroll down-bottom-top-down - scrolling starts from current record,
           when :hitBottom is detected, jumps to top of the browser and starts 
           scrolling downwards.
       2. Scroll down-bottom - scrolling starts from current record and keeps 
           on downward. It does not check if :hitBottom is reached or not.
           Useful when user needs what latest records are being pushed into 
           the table.
       3. Sctoll to bottom of browser and issues :goBottom() always.
           Useful when user needs to review the latest info.

       A <Stop> push button stays in the bottom row+ location to stop the scrolling.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Added: internal function __hbqtGetNextIdAsString( cString ) -> cString_<runningNumber>

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    % Changed: :setFocus() from PROTECTED to PUBLIC.
    + Implemented: vertical navigation with K_UP, K_DOWN, K_PGUP, K_PGDN,
       K_CTRL_PGUP, K_CTRL_PGDN while inside INCREMENTAL search mode.
       Under many situations this behaviour is very much required.

2013-01-07 05:36 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtalert.prg
    % Renamed: HbQtGetSome(...) => HbQtBulkGet(...)
    + Added: treating the GET in a combobox if one of the elements of 
       HbQtBulkGet()'s <xVariable> is an array of character strings. The 
       RETURN value will be a string of choice selected in combobox. the 
       first prompt in such array will be the default option when combo 
       is presented.

       Thanks to Angel Pais for the idea.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    % Changed: call to HbQtGetSome() with HbQtBulkGet().

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browser.prg
    % Minor.

2013-01-03 13:50 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added: HBQTBRW_* constants, usable to configure HbQtBrowse interface.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtalert.prg
    + Implemented: Function 
       HbQtGetSome( <xVariable>, [<xCaption>], [<xPicture>], [<xWhen>], [<xValid>], [<cTitle>] ) -> <xVariable>

       A general purpose function to fetch values of one or many GETS in a modal dialog.

       <xVariable> an array of variables or a single variable to GET.
          
                   If <xVariable> is an array of variables then all the following 
                   parameters must be an array of attributes matching the length of 
                   <xVariables>. Function does not check for the number of array indexes.

       <xCaption>  variable(s)|Literal(s) describing the GET. Defaults to "Variable_" + hb_ntos( nIndex ).
       <xPicture>  variable(s)|Literal(s) of PICTURE templates. Defaults to "".
       <xWhen>     block(s) to supply for :preValidate. Defaults to {|| .T. }.
       <xValid>    block(s) to supply for :postValidate. Defaults to {|| .T. }.

       <cTitle>    Title to display on GETs dialog's titlebar. Defaults to "Enter Some Values!".

       RETURNS     <xVariable> in the form they are supplied to the function. If ESCape is 
                   pressed then original values supplied to the function are returned.

                   GETs dialog is centered on the window which has focus at the time of 
                   calling this function.

       NOTE:       Name of the function may be changed. If you have a better name, please forward.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Added: <GoTo> icon on the browser's toolbar to navigate to a designated record.
    + Implemented: ACCESS/ASSIGN method :gotoBlock  to execute :goto() method, either via 
       appln call or activating it via toolbar icon <Goto>. Interface just exposes the 
       visual elements to inform the appln about user interaction. The actual navigation 
       is performed at the appln level only. How...

         Appln: oBrowse:gotoBlock := {|| GotoMyRecord() }  
         User:  Clicks on the <Goto> icon. :gotoBlock is evaluated.
         Appln:
           STATIC FUNCTION GotoMyRecord()
           LOCAL nRec, nPRec := RecNo()
           IF ( nRec := HbQtGetSome( nPRec, "Record Number", , , , "GoTo ?" ) ) > 0
              dbGoto( nRec )
           ELSE
             RETURN .F.
           ENDIF
           RETURN nPRec != nRec

       If the :gotoBlock returns TRUE, the browser is refreshed, otherwise not.

    + Added: <Indexes> combobox on the browser's toolbar to change the index order.
    + Implemented: ACCESS/ASSIGN method :indexes. This accepts an array of index information as:

        AAdd( aIndexes, { "Natural Order", {|oBrw| dbSetOrder( 0 ), oBrw:refreshAll(), oBrw:forceStable() } } )
        AAdd( aIndexes, { "Last Name"    , {|oBrw| dbSetOrder( 1 ), oBrw:refreshAll(), oBrw:forceStable() } } )
        oBrowse:indexes := { aIndexes, 2 }

        First element of <aIndexes> is used to populate the <Indexes> combobox.
        Second element is a codeblock which will be executed when an option in combobox 
          is activated. 
        Second element of :indexes ASSIGNed array is used to activate <Indexes> combobox.
 
        <Indexes> combobox is viaible only if appln has supplied :indexes information.

        This is a convenient mechanism to armour the end user with many more options.

    % ReImplemented <Search> option. Please discard the previous documentation. 
       This new implementation empowers you with executing an incremental search, 
       a search within the unindexed field and much more. How...

        Appln: oBrowse:searchBlock := {|xValue,nMode,oBrw| LookMySearch( xValue,nMode,oBrw ) } 
                                         -> 
                                      { [<xValue>], [<cPicture>], [<nMode]> }

        Appln: Inside :navigationBlock - :search( [<xValue>], [<cPicture>], [<nMode]> )
        Interface: <Search> icon - :search()
        
        METHOD Search( [<xValue>], [<cPicture>], [<nMode]> )
          If [<xValue>] == NIL, :searchBlock will be called to obtain <Search> info as:
            IF HB_ISBLOCK( ::searchBlock )
               aInfo := Eval( ::searchBlock, NIL, NIL, Self )
            ENDIF

          It will be the responsibility of the appln to supply info regarding what to fetch 
          and how to respond to search creteria. If appln does not return back an array of 
          3 elements, viz., 1. What to search as a variable of type CDNL, viz., 
          space( 30 ), 0, or whatever, and mode of search (read below), then these three values
          defaults to : 1. the value returned by Eval( ::getColumn( ::colPos ):block )
                        2. ::getColumn( ::colPos ):picture
                        3. HBQTBRW_SEARCH_ONCE 
                             Other options:
                           HBQTBRW_SEARCH_INCREMENTAL
                           HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD
          depending upon the above three values, interface exposes a modal GET at the 
          last+ row of the browser window to fetch <Search> value, initially set with 
          value of <xValue>.

          The next action is carried out in accordance with <nMode>:
          IF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_ONCE
            Dialog to fetch value is closed, :serachBlock is evaluated again with modified 
            <xValue>, <nMode> and <Self>. Appln takes appropriate action. Typicaly, 
            appln will invoke this mode if an index is active.
          
          IF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_INCREMENTAL
            Dialog to fetch serach value stays, with every change in the GET value, 
            :serachBlock is evaluated with modified <xValue>, <nMode> and <Self>. 
            Appln takes appropriate action. Dialog to fetch search value stays until 
            RETURN is pressed which mark the end of the <Search> event. For the duration 
            of search, browser cursor is changed to ROW mode. Typicaly, 
            appln will invoke this mode if an index is active.

          IF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD
            Dialog to fetch value is closed. A timer event is started inside the interface
            at a 10 ms interval, which calls :searchBlock as usual. Then :searchBlock is 
            expected to return TRUE or FALSE to flag that <Search> is found or not. If NOT,
            then browser is moved down by one row. If YES or :hitBottom is detected then 
            <Serach> event is terminated. Appln can detect <ESC> press in the :navigationBlock,
            and can terminate the <Search> accordingly (study example below).

          In case of nMode == INCREMENTAL, after <Search> event is terminated, 
            :searchBlock is once again evaluated with no parameters. This is useful 
            to implement a lookup browser.

          Here is a minimum useful example, you can extend it to extreme:

          STATIC nLastKey := 0

          FUNCTION Main()
             LOCAL oBrowse := ...

             oBrowse:searchBlock     := {|xValue,nMode,oBrw| LookMySearch( xValue,nMode,oBrw ) }
             oBrowse:navigationBlock := {|nKey,xData,oBrw|  HandleMyOptions( nKey,xData,oBrw ) }

             RETURN NIL

          STATIC FUNCTION HandleMyOptions( nKey,xData,oBrowse )
             LOCAL xResult, i
             LOCAL lHandelled := .T.

             nLastKey := nKey
             ...

             RETURN .t. 

          STATIC FUNCTION LookMySearch( xValue,nMode,oBrw )
             LOCAL nRec
          
             IF xValue == NIL .AND. oBrw == NIL
                /* search is finished, take other action, this will help to build a selectable browser */
                Alert( "Current Record Number Is : " + hb_ntos( RecNo() ) )
          
             ELSEIF xValue == NIL                           /* Interface is requesting to initiate search */
                IF IndexOrd() == 1
                   RETURN { Space( Len( TEST->last ) ), NIL, HBQTBRW_SEARCH_INCREMENTAL }
                ELSE
                   RETURN { NIL, NIL, HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD }
                ENDIF
          
             ELSE
                IF IndexOrd() == 1                          /* Interface is requesting to do the search as per needs */
                   nRec := RecNo()
                   IF ! dbSeek( Trim( xValue ) )
                      dbGoto( nRec )
                   ELSE
                      oBrw:refreshAll()
                   ENDIF
                ELSEIF nMode == HBQTBRW_SEARCH_BYFIELD
                   IF nLastKey == K_ESC

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqtableview.h
  * hbqt/qtgui/qth/HBQTableView.qth
    + Added: method - QRect visualRect( QModelIndex )
       The method was a "vrtual protected".

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added: QREAD ... NOFOCUSFRAME 
       Flag to disable displaying a red bordered frame around the active GET.
       Was needed to implement in-place editing of browser cells ( Read below ).

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    % Changed: the way FocusFrame was being constructed.
      Now every GetList has its own oFocusFrame instead of a single frame across
      the whole application, which had a drawback to not show-up if multiple 
      GET screens were floated at once. Also the visiblility of focus frame 
      is controllable by QREAD clause NOFOCUSFRAME.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: in-place cell editing with PICTURE, COLOR, WHEN, VALID clauses.
       This is in addition to record editing in a separate adjoining dialog which 
       is called by application as oBrw:edit(...) or by clicking on the <Edit>
       icon of browser toolbar.

       On the contrary, Cell editing is only callable by the application. This 
       can be called as :

         oBrw:editCell( [<cPicture>], [<cColor>], [<bWhen>], [<bValid>] ) -> xModifiedValue
           <cPicture> Defaults to oColumn:picture.
           <cColor>   Defaults to "N/BG*"
           <bWhen>    Defaults to oColumn:preBlock
           <bValid>   Defaults to oColumn:postBlock

       How it works;
         
          ...
          oBrw:navigationBlock( {|...| NavigateMe(...) } )
          ...

          FUNCTION NavigateMe( nKey...)
             SWITCH nKey
             CASE K_SH_F12
                xModifiedValue := oBrw:editCell()
                IF xModifiedValue != NIL  /* In Case ESC is Pressed */      
                   // Save xModifiedValue at appropriate container.
                ENDIF
             ENDSWITCH

         The above is the minimum required. If :editCell() is called without 
         supplying any arguments, then defaults are applied to GET the value.
         If ESCape is pressed on the GET then NIL is returned. In that case 
         appln can take the appropriate action.

         Current highlighted cell is subject to :cellEdit() call.
         oColumn:block with <xModifiedValue> is __ALWAYS__ called when 
         RETURN is pressed on GET and is postValidated.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browser.prg
    + Added code to demonstrate how to use cell editing.

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg
    + Added: following CASE statement in navigation SWITCH:
         
         CASE nKey == K_SH_F12
            IF dbRLock()
               oBrowse:panHome()
               oBrowse:Right()
               FOR i := 2 TO oBrowse:colCount()
                  xResult := oBrowse:editCell()  /* HbQt Entention */
                  IF xResult == NIL
                     EXIT                        /* ESCape is pressed */
                  ENDIF
                  SWITCH oBrowse:getColumn( i ):heading
                  CASE "Last Name"  ; REPLACE TEST->last     WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "First Name" ; REPLACE TEST->first    WITH xResult ; EXIT

                  CASE "HireDate"   ; REPLACE TEST->HireDate WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "Age"        ; REPLACE TEST->Age      WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "City"       ; REPLACE TEST->City     WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "State"      ; REPLACE TEST->State    WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "Zip"        ; REPLACE TEST->Zip      WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  CASE "Notes"      ; REPLACE TEST->Notes    WITH xResult ; EXIT
                  ENDSWITCH
                  oBrowse:refreshCurrent()
                  IF i < oBrowse:colCount()
                     oBrowse:Right()
                  ENDIF
               NEXT
               IF xResult != NIL
                  dbCommit()
               ENDIF
               dbRUnlock()
            ENDIF
         OTHERWISE

    ; This demonstrate the exact usage one might had employed in Clipper 
      application to fetch data entry in a browser. In any real-world 
      senario, ground is ready to be exploited. Now I can dream of porting 
      my Harbour simulated console/GUI applns to HbQt.

2012-12-26 15:23 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: Browser Printing. How...

       Activation: 
         Application code - oBrw:print( cPrinter, lOpenPrintDialog )
         Interface        - <Print> icon on the browser toolbar

       After Activation:
         Looks for oBrw:title. If a value is found, then it is interpreted as
           SWITCH valtype( ::title )
           CASE "C"
              aTitle := hb_aTokens( ::title, ";" ) - Just like Alert().
           CASE ""A"
              aTitle := ::title
           CASE "B"
              aTitle := Eval( ::title, NIL, NIL, oBrw )
              Again <aTitle> is tested for string or array, and treated as above.
           ENDSWITCH
         <aTitle> defaults to { "Browsed Data" }
         <aTitle> is then printed on top of each page printed.
         First 5 Lines are significant. If more are supplied, those are ignored.

         Next line after <aTitle> is done with is :
           DtoC( Date() ) + " " + Time() + " " + "Page:" + hb_ntos( #pageNo )
         
         Next follow Headers Line.

         Then follows the actual data.

         Columns are printed exactly as seen in the browser, with same font, 
         picture and colors. So it gives a WYSIWYG look. Most of the time printed 
         output is pleasing.

         The only those columns, counted from left, make up to the printed output 
         as many fit into the page width for printer in question. To start with 
         PORTRAIT mode is selected, but you can always get LANDSCAPE output 
         from the PREVIEWER dialog. More columns then will be automatically 
         accomodated.

         I found a nasty bug, apparently in Qt itself, as follows:
         If QPrintDialog is executed, either inside browse code, or inside
         previwer window, application GPFs. So far I have not found a solution
         what is happening. It may be due that my laptop is not actively 
         connected to a printer and hence Qt has some issues there. Later 
         I will revisit the code in my office to get more clues. Till 
         then...

         If you find motivation to debug, please uncomment some code in 
         hbqtbrowse.prg and recompile yourself. If you find any solution,
         please report me back.

  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    * Version bump.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqabstractitemmodel.cpp
    ! Minor.

  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.qrc
  + hbqtwidgets/resources/*.png
    + Resource Images.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
    + Added: hbqtwidgets.qrc

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Added: __hbqtImage( cPngWithoutExt )
       The function can be used in appln also to obtain many
       common usage images. This may eliminate the need to have 
       application local images. Hopefully will reduce the burden
       on application part.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    % Changed: :editBlock's parameters.
       oBrw:editBlock := {| oBrw, aOrg, aMod, aCap | ... }
         =>
       oBrw:editBlock := {| aMod, {aOrg,aCap}, oBrw | ... }
       
       It is in accordance with decided protocol where any application
       supplied codeBlock, implemented over and above TBrowse blocks, 
       will be fired with three parameters. First parameter will represent 
       the most expected return value, 2nd will contain any additional 
       data important and ancilliary to the 1st param, and 3rd will 
       always be browse object in evaluating the block.

    % Changed: method :openEditor(...) => edit(...)
               method :edit() => editCell()
                 Confirms to general common sense.

    + Implemented: ToolBar on top of the browser window. 
       Toolbar can be toggled to be displayed/hidden. Toolbar contains common 
       actions a user always expect off a GUI browser, viz., 

         Edit | Print | Search | GoTop | Up | Down | GoBottom | PanHome | Left |
         Right | PanEnd | ComboToColumn | MoveFirst | MoveLeft | MoveRight | MoveLast
       
       Toggling the display of toolbar is controlled via ACCESS | ASSIGN method :toolbar.

         oBrw:toolbar := ! oBrw:toolbar

       By default ToolBar is hidden.

       <Print> option is not active yet.

    + Implemented: activation/execution of context menu. This is controlled as:

         oBrw:contextMenuBlock := {| oPos, NIL, oBrw | ... }

       When context menu request is detected, HbQtBrowse will look for :contextMenuBlock,
       and if found, will evaluate it with global mouse position (QPoint) as 1st param,
       NIL as 2nd, and Self as 3rd. It will be the responsibility of appln to respond 
       to this event. 

       And if :contextMenuBlock will not be supplied by the appln, a default context 
       menu will be executed with some of the actions available on the toolbar.

    + Implemented: StatusBar at the bottom of the browse window.
       Again it is controlled by application, like:

         oBrw:statusbar := .T. 
           OR
         oBrw:statusbar := ! oBrw:statusbar

       To display message on the StatusBar:

         oBrw:statusMessage := cMessage

       To clear the StatusBar:

         oBrw:statusMessage := ""       

       By default ToolBar is hidden.
    
    + Implemented: SEARCH feature, interface and building blocks only.
       Application will take responsibility to carry on the search operation.
       HbQtBrowser merely provides the interface to communicate between browser 
       interface and application code. How ...

       1. Appln will post a block as:

            oBrw:searchBlock := {|xSearch, nColPos, oBrw| ... }

       2. The SEARCH event could be started either by browser interface or 
          application inside :navigationBlock. 
           
          Interface: Click on the <Search> toolbar button.
          Application: calling oBrw:search( xValue ).

          In both instances, a single GET in a modal window will be presented.
          If appln has initiated the SEARCH, and has provided <xValue> in 
          :search( xValue ) call, then this variable is GET. If click on 
          <Search> icon has initiated it, or <xValue> == NIL, then the 
          value contained in current hilighted cell of browser will be GET.
          In the latter case, column's PICTURE is also applied to it.
          GET will terminate on RETURN press, and searchBlock will be evaluated
          with GET value as 1st param. From here it is the responsibility of 
          the appln to perform the actual search.

          The demo code is included in tests/browser.prg and test/browdb.prg.
          browser.prg addresses it for an array, while browdb.prg on a table.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
    + Added: clause LASTGETBLOCK <lastGetBlock>
       With this QREAD command looks as:

       #command QREAD [ [ PARENT ] <GetParent> ] ;
                      [ FONT <oFont>           ] ;
                      [ LINESPACING <nSpc>     ] ;
                      [ TITLE <title>          ] ;
                      [ ICON <icon>            ] ;
                      [<nomodal:NOMODAL>       ] ;
                      [ PROPERTIES <prop>      ] ;
                      [ LASTGETBLOCK <bLast>   ] ;
                            => ;
             HbQtReadGets( @GetList, SayList, <GetParent>, <oFont>, <nSpc>, ;
                           <title>, <icon>, <.nomodal.>, <{prop}>, <{bLast}> )

       ; Read below.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetlist.prg
    + Added: method lastGetBlock( bBlock ) SETGET
       Placeholder to hold <lastGetBlock> of QREAD.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtgetsys.prg
    + Implemented: to detect if GET in focus is the last GET in current GetList,
                   and if yes, then fire the <lastGetObject> block. The check
                   is performed in :postValidate() method.

  * hbqtwidgets/hbqtbrowse.prg
    + Implemented: browser row editor honoring the :preBlock, :postBlock, :picture
       properties of columns. Thanks to QGET/QREAD of HbQt which made it possible 
       to happen. The whole process is application controlled as per the true spirit 
       of TBrowse. The following methods are exposed to the application:

         :editBlock( bBlock ) GETSET
            The block is responsible to "SAVE" data collected with editor widget.
            If no :editBlock is specifed, a simple oColumn:block is evaluated
            with modified data as its only parameter.
            :editBlock has to be defined as:

            oBrowse:editBlock := {|oBrw, aOriginal, aModified, aCaptions|  ;
                                      SaveMyData( oBrw, aOriginal, aModified, aCaptions ) }

            at the minimum. Application may pass other parameters to the "SAVE" 
            function as appropriate. Here is brief description of 4 parameters:
            
            <oBrw>      No need to explain, it is oBrowse in question.
            <aOriginal> Array holding original values of the columns before "SAVE" 
                        is requested. It is sent to facilitate better control 
                        on determining what needs to be saved in real.
            <aModified> Array holding modified values of the columns.
            <aCaptions> Array holding <oColumn:heading> property. This facilitates
                        to recognize which data item needs to be updated.
             
            NOTE: Tbrowse does not know anything about the data source. Also columns
                  in a browse can be ordered to any position. So it is difficult 
                  to guess where a modified value needs be saved. Here comes the 
                  importance of <oColumn:heading>. I believe, you all must be 
                  providing unique headings to columns, and if not, please set 
                  your code right to grab the power of GUI editing.

         :openEditor( cTitle, lSaveOnLastGet, lDownAfterSave )
            The method needs to be called by the application, generally detecing 
            an event in :navigationBlock, but may be by other means also. This opens 
            a modal dialog adjoining the right edge of browser viewport. Editor will 
            display <cTitle> in the title-bar. The position and size will be saved 
            for current session of underlying browser. Next invocation will position
            it at last closing coordinates. Edotor is composed of a scrollable 
            QFormLayout based form containing the GETs of columns data. At the bottom 
            are 5 buttons with corresponding accelerator keys. Focus will be 
            positioned on the first GET ( column ). Navigation of the GETs is 
            per Harbour standards. WHEN, VALID and PICTURE instance variables are 
            applied over the GETs. 

            When last GET is hit by ENTER, <lSaveOnLastGet> [Defaults to TRUE], will 
            be examined. If TRUE, the <lastGetBlock> is fired with 4 parameters, i.e.,
            <oBrw><aOriginal><aModified><aCaptions>. A LOGICAL is expected as the 
            return value of the <lastGetBlock>. If it is TRUE, no further action is 
            taken. If FALSE, <oColumn:block> is fired with modified value as parameter.

            Then <lDownAfterSave> [Defaults to TRUE] is examined. If TRUE, the browser
            is moved with :down(), column values are gathered, GETs are populated 
            with new row value. The process goes on until user closes the Editor.
            Editor can be closed either by ESCAPing or clicking on X button.

            The bottom area buttons offer following functionality:

            <Save> <ALT+S        > Triggers "SAVE" action as described above.
            <Down> <ALT+DownArrow> Moves the browser :down() and refresh the GETs.
            <Up>   <ALT+UpArrow  > Moves the browser :up() and refresh the GETs.
            <Btm>  <ALT+PageDown > Moves the browser :goBottom() and refresh the GETs.
            <Top>  <ALT+PageUp   > Moves the browser :goTop() and refresh the GETs.

            needed changes as per user inputs.

    + TBrowse:
       :verticalScrollbar := TRUE  [ Default: FALSE - Clipper Compatible ]
          Displays the vertical scroolbar to navigate the database/array.
          To use it effectively you need to define following blocks [with example]:

            oBrowse:firstPosBlock       := {| | 1                }
            oBrowse:lastPosBlock        := {| | LastRec()        }
            IF indexOrd() == 0
               oBrowse:posBlock         := {| | RecNo()          }
               oBrowse:goPosBlock       := {|n| DbGoto( n )      }
               oBrowse:phyPosBlock      := {| | RecNo()          }
            ELSE
               oBrowse:posBlock         := {| | OrdKeyNo()       }
               oBrowse:goPosBlock       := {|n| OrdKeyGoto( n )  }
               oBrowse:phyPosBlock      := {| | OrdKeyNo()       }
            ENDIF
      
        :horizontalScrollbar := TRUE [ Default: FALSE - Clipper Compatible ]
            No property is needed to set for its navigation.

        :cursorMode := HBQTBRW_CURSOR_ROW [Default: HBQTBRW_CURSOR_COLUMN ]
            This is equivalent to :colorRect.

  + hbqtwidgets/tests/browdb.prg

       5. Currently, switched off Scrollbars, those require extension to 
           TBrowse, your opinion ?
       6. Fonts.

    ; SHOULD WE ADD:
       1. Support for scrollbars ? Will need :goTopBlock like implementation.
       2. Right Side Freezing ?
       3. Extended colors in :colorSpec, like in GETs ?

  * hbqtwidgets/tests/validator.prg
    + Extended: OOPLayout() function to demonstrate the use of 
       multiple layouts with HbQtGet()s spread on them. 
       This technique can be used organize GETs verically and 
       horizontally. Note that navigation will follow the creation

       <title>   string to show up in the title-bar of the parent window.
       <icon>    string or QIcon to set for parents title-bar.
       <nomodal> logical to set the GETs window modeless.

       NOTE: all above parameters are applied to the parent if no parent is 
             supplied with [PARENT] clause. If QREAD is issued with oParent,
             then it is programmers responsibility to configure as per his/her taste.

       <prop>    code block to set the properties of the parent window.
                 The block is executed passing two arguments; 
                   1. oParent
                   2. oGetList
                 This facilitates to set any property Qt provides for the GET dialog.
                 This raises the bar for the programmer but still offering utmost 
                 simplicity for console programmers.

       NOTE: <prop> code block is called for every type of parent hosting the GETs.

       Hopefully by tomorrow a basic implementation will be in place.
       Many ideas and protocols are evolving. Idea is to have this 
       integrated with Harbour GET System isolated or/and with .ui
       widgets.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    % Adjusted to take effect sub-system changes.

  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtstd.ch
  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbc
  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbp
  + hbqtwidgets/hbqtwidgets.hbx
    + Added: hbqtwidgets library which will host the components based on 
       pure HbQt. This, the first, components is Harbour's GET sub-system 
       usable in HbQt with pure GUI widgets. HbQt GET System almost 
       simulates the Harbour GETs with <SAY>, <VALID>, <WHEN>, 
       <PICTURE>, <COLOR> clauses at the minimum required to port 
       console mode Clipper code to GUI. In addition provides the 
       extended VALIDation protocol. 

       In the coming days, Harbour's powerful GET system is scheduled 
       to be integrated with Qt Designer designed widgets. A working 
       prototype is in place but needs a bit more work to be committed.

  * qtcontribs.hbp
    + Added: hbqtwidget library.

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    * Cleanup.

  * hbqt/tests/hbmk.hbm
    + Added: hbqtwidgets.hbc

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    - Removed: code specific to hbqtwidgets library.

  ; To use HbQt GET System you will need to link hbqtwidgets library 
      with your project. Add a line to your.hbp : hbqtwidgets.hbc.

    ! mainly code clean-up, removed redundancy.

2012-12-09 02:05 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    ! Small fix.

  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Many, many, many improvements.
       In nutshell, the engine is rewritten to overload Harbour's
       GET sub-system and encapsulate it in its entirety. All 
       GETs related functions are working, e.g., GetActive():varGet()/Put().

     + @ ... QSAY ... QGET ... is functional.
     + PageUp/Dn navigates to First and Last gets.
     ! VALID is not evaluated if WHEN could not been validated.
     + Array GETs are working.

     ; Please test and report differences.

2012-12-07 01:27 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Demonstrated: how a Clipper form can be executed in a scrollable
       widget. Resize the window and experience how scrolling is working.
       This way we can present much larger forms then a typical Clipper
       screen could offer. 

    + Implemented: "@E" and "@Snn" PICTURE functions.

2012-12-06 18:56 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: ROW/COL properties of GETs.

    + Implemented: @ <nRow>, <nCol> QSAY <exp> PICTURE <pic> COLOR <clr>.
       COLOR is not yet implemented, needs discussion.

    + Implemented: Clipper like form creation with @ SAY, @ GET commands
       given a parent window without any layout. 

    + Implemented: support of QFont to be applied to SAYs and GETS.
       This automatically sets the size and 

    ! Made: Clipper like form the startup display mode. Send "P" as 
       parameter to invoke OOP code screen.

    ; NOTE: we are almost near to design a GUI screen with Clipper code.
            QFont supplied to the form is not set on parent window. It is 
            applied only to SAYs and GETs. The rows are calculated on the 
            basis of QFont:height() and each row is separated by 6 pixels.

    ;       This seems, the whole protocol can be enhanced to a greater 
            horizon with a possibility to have multiple forms in one window.

       not been validated. [ TODO: should be switchable on user request ].

2012-12-05 18:09 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: real-time validation indication in the form of 
       change in background-color of edit instance. The Clipper variable 
       is only updated if RETURN or TAB is pressed, just like Clipper.
    + Matured: numeric GET entry protocol. In some ways it is better 
       than Clipper's. PICTURE clause is completely supported.

    ; NOTE: with this basic implementation of Harbour GET System is 
            complete. Please test with your in-production code, if possible.
            If you find differences, please report. Also it will be 
            helpful if you supply some complex PICTURE clauses used 
            in your applications to be added to this demo code.

    ; OPINION: seems this class can be entirely ported to C++ as HBQGet.
               Should it remain as PRG class or be shifted to C++ ?

    ; NEXT: class/code to generate a data-aware form encapsulating
            @ <nRow>,<nCol> SAY <exp,...> GET <exp,...>.

       text of editing buffer and can be changed in the the PRG source.

    + Implemented: Templates for Numeric GETs, please test.
       VALID is broken if value of a numeric GET is invalid and focus 
       is placed on another object with mouse-click and then returned 
       to numeric GET. I am at a loss to understand the behavior of 
       QValidator in this respect as why it receives :Intermediate
       return and then never set it back.

2012-12-03 19:02 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: GET Picture Templates in addition to Picture Functions.
    + Implemented: Numeric GET "+-." positioning, confirmation to pre
       and post decimal width. Currently based on variables original value.
       ;
       TODO: implementation of Picture Teplates.
    + Completed: Date GET implementation. Now it supports Set( _SET_DATEFORMAT ).
    + Implemented: mouse support as default. To switch off the mouse interaction
       call oEdit:mousable := .F. .
    + Implemented: changed background color to somewhat red of any GET if 
       if focus is taken away from it by mouse action and the value 
       contained in the edit buffer could not been validated with VALID 
       clause. This is a visual only part and actual VALID is performed
       only by keyboard navigation.
    + Added one more field "Telephone Number:" which facilitates the 
       verification of template part of picture.

    ; Please test extensively and report back if you see any issues with 
       GET picture with/without template part.

    + Logical: always remains selected, so edit does not need backspace.
    + Numeric: right aligned if picture function does not contain "B".
    + ESC: form is closed if ESCAPE is pressed.
    + :inputValidator is called after respecting picture clause.
    ! Picture function "K" is the default behavior except is LOgicals. 
       And this is the preferred way in GUI.

2012-12-01 21:20 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Applied: "Courier New" size 10 font on HbQtGet() objects.
       It offers better input experience much like Clipper.

  * hbxbp/browse.prg
    ! Fixed: long-standing bug in IdeDBU where CTRL+PgUp/Dn were 
       nor refreshing the contents of rows.

2012-12-01 19:07 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Implemented: @ <nX>, <nY> QGET <v> PICTURE <pic> COLOR <color> ;
                     WHEN <when> VALID <valid> VALIDATOR <validator>;
                     CAPTION <cap>

                   QREAD

       This implementation demonstrates how Clipper code can be 
       re-used in GUI environment. The implementation demonstrate 
       both, OOP and COMMAND syntax usages. Execute validator.exe 
       with "p" as parameter to invoke COMMAND code.

       Presently suppoted PICTURE strings are "@!" for character 
       and "Y" for logicals. Others will come up next.

       COLOR clause supports Cliiper's standard 16 colors. It can be 
       passed as "W+/B",   "B",    "W+/BG*", i.e., foreground/background
       pair. Only one color will be applied to text color.

       Data binding is implemented via :dataLink( bBlock ) method.

       For COMMAND syntax, to fetch set/get block, Harbour's 
       GET system is used. Hope it can be exploited further.

2012-12-01 02:41 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Updated: to confirm to Clipper Get System with WHEN and VALIDS.
       The code hosts a small class inherited from QLineEdit which 
       controls the edit behavior of gets both per navigation and 
       input standards. ENTER and UP/DOWN arrows also behave 
       per Clipper standards. The implementation completely by-pass 
       mouse input, i.e., no edit is selectable with mouse click.
       This was required to implement WHEN and VALID.

       The class is still a work in progress. As I am feeling tired 
       and also it is almost morning, I need to sleep. In the meantime
       examine the code and post your views/opinions/suggestions/whatever.
       Also keep in mind to suggest where such classes, which simulate,
       Clipper behavior, should be hosted.

2012-11-30 14:43 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    % HBQValidator block returning QValidator:Intermediate if the supplied 
       text is empty. This is always the case when edit object is 
       presented for input the first time. Also it relieves the programmer
       to implement it on every GET manually.

2012-11-30 13:12 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqt_hbqvalidator.cpp
    + Implemented: QValidator::Intermediate return value.
       HOW: If the validating function return NIL as sole return-value 
              OR
            NIL as third element of returned array;
            QValidator::Intermediate is returned back to QValidator::validate().

  * hbqt/qtgui/hbqtgui.hbx
    + Added: HBQValidator() sub-class inheriting QValidator().
       This facilitates to simulate Harbour Get System's input behavior, 
       primarily in relation to picture clause at the minimum. But it 
       is much more then that. A clever use can put you under total 
       control what exactly you want the user to input.

       SYNTAX:  oEdit := QLineEdit( oWnd )
                oEdit:setValidator( HBQValidator( {|cText, nPos| DoValidation( cText, nPos ) } ) ) 

       RETURN VALUE OF VALIDATION BLOCK:
                It is important to understand the rationale of return 
                value of code-block supplied as only parameter to 
                HBQValidator which controls the behavior of validation.
                This can be one of the following:

                1. NIL     : will be treated as input is valid.
                2. .T.     : will be treated as input is valid.
                3. .F.     : will not allow the current character.
                4. String  : will replace the input string with returned string.
                5. Numeric : will relocate the editing cursor to this position.
                6. Array   : { cModifiedText|NIL, nCursorPos|NIL, lValid|NIL }
                             the elements corresponds to above #4, #5, #1;2;3

  + hbqt/tests/validator.prg
    + Added: a demonstration appln consuming HBQValidator() with 
       3 different constraints with many sub-variants which clearly 
       shows the power of this class. You can experiment further and 
       can add interesting combinations in this demo.

  ; WORKING:
    1. Now function name holds the key if a function documentation will be 
         replaced or added to the .txt file being modified. This means, 
         changing the name of the function will add an entry with new name.
         The match is case insensitive, i.e., WvgCheckBox() will be equal to 
         WvgCHECKbox().

    2. All the other upper entries are retained as is if some exist, i.e. like
         copyright notices or SVN header.

    3. Has eliminated the keyword $FUNCNAME$ from entire repository and

        2. Fill in the fields.
        3. Click on "Save written/updated documenttaion" toolbar icon.
        4. FileSave dialog will be presented to obtain folder where to save.
             FileName will be auto-constructed from type and function name.
             You can keep it as is or change per your liking.
        5. A confirmation message will be displayed if it is saved successfully.
      
      Both ways SVN Id header will be placed on top of the documentation file.

    ; WHAT WE CAN LOOSE IF EXISTING DOCUMENTATION IS EDITED:  
        
        1. Copyright notices posted on top of the file.
        2. $COMPLIANCE$ is converted to $PLATFORMS$ and is only oneliner.
        3. If $COMPLIANCE$ and $PLATFORMS$ both are present then only 
             $COMPLIANCE$ is retained.
        4. Leading "*" will not be present
        5. may be more but I have observed above differences 
             while experimenting with harbour/doc/en/*.txt files.

  * hbide/hbide_v.ch
    * Usual: last commit info.

  + hbide/requests.ch
    + Added: header to REQUEST all codepages Harbour supports.
       Just in case...

  * hbide/editor.prg
  * hbide/main.prg
  * hbide/misc.prg
  * hbide/saveload.prg
  * hbide/sources.prg
    + Added: <Main Menu><Encoding> option.
       It displays the codepages in this notation: 
         Harbour Codepage Name : Unique Codepage ID => "RU866 : cp866"

    + Implemented: per source Harbour supported codepage.
       Now you can write sources supporting different code pages for 
       strings inside source text. Each edit instance can have its own 
       codepage which can be selected from <Encoding> main-menu option.
       HbIDE remembers codepage associated with a source. When selecting 
       a codepage from <Encoding> option, you will be prompted to set 
       it as "default". The <Default> codepage will be applied to any 
       new source brought to HbIDE for editing. 

    ; IMPORTANT : Please read
       1. Setup this current commit or release.
       2. DO NOT execute HbIDE.
       3. Open hbide.ini you are supplying to execute HbIDE.
       4. Change: CurrentCodec=_HarbourCodePageName_ => 
                  CurrentCodec=EN
       5. Execute HbIDE.
       6. Notice the statusbar of HbIDE where codepage entry should be 
            visible as "Enc: EN | EN".
       7. First part denotes codepage of this source, second part 
            default codepage.
       8. If you need to change the codepage of a source, make sure that 
            it has not been modified before the change, initiate change 
            from <Encoding> option, close HbIDE, do not save the source 
            when prompted, run HbIDE again. This action can be taken for 
            multiple source instances. Just REMEMBER that you have not 
            to save the source after changing the codepage.

    ; THANKS : Special thanks to Grzegorz and Maurizio for helping me 
               understand what is happening under the hood.

      Please make extensive tests. Regression is possible.
 
2012-10-24 14:31 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  + Applied patch by Francesco Perillo (as explained below), thank you.

  * qtcontribs.hbp 
    ! all not-essential Qt modules are remmed by default. 
      You need to remove the remark if you want them to be compiled. 
      Too much problems reported for aborted builds. In the future we may 
      add checks and skip modules missing include files, for the moment it 
      will be programmers responsability to un-rem them
    + added -hbcontainer so that the error line about nm is not shown

  * hbide/hbide.hbp
    ! added instpath to current harbour BIN path. This means that hbide 
      will be copied in the same directory where harbour executable is ! 
      This will work both for simple "make" and for "make install"
    ! modified output dir that is anyway replaced by instpath directive

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbp
    + added $hb_pkg_install.hbm
    ! changed path for lib creation

  * hbxbp/hbxbp.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker 
      can find the files created in the path set in hbxbp.hbp file

  * hbqt/hbqt_common.hbm
    ! changed lib target directory
    + copied $hb_pkg_install.hbm content and modified to fit hbQt build method. 
      the standard hbm file uses lib name to create a subdir where to store its 
      files during install. This is ok for simple libraries like hbxbp, 
      where only one lib is created, while it is a problem for hbQT where several 
      libraries are created... otherwise we would get addons/hbqtcore addons/hbqtgui. 
      no way....  So the changes was just to set hbqt as target directory, 
      all the rest unmodified...

  * hbqt/hbqt.hbc
    + added libpaths directive. This adds a new lib directory so the linker 
      can find the files created in the path set in hbqt_common.hbm file

  + hbide/hbide_v.ch
    + Readded: the header containing latest revision number.
       This is done because otherwise HbIDE cannot be built by a 
       user who has not properly set QtContribs build environment,
       which, along other things, require subversion client installed
       on his machine. Mostly it will never be required for average user 
       but just in case...

       NOTE: this will always publish one revision less than the current 
             in HbIDE title-bar.

2012-10-07 15:34 UTC-0800 Pritpal Bedi (bedipritpal at hotmail.com)
  * hbqt/hbmk2_qt.hb
    % Changed: the version guard agaisnt which a class is compiled.
       Earlier every class was guarded against v4.5.
       Now class is guarded against minimum of v4.5 or defined for 
       a class in .qth in CLASS section. 
         <CLASS> 
         ...
         Version = 0x040n00

    % Optimizations.
    + Implemented: concept of manageable tool-box containing almost 
       entire set of actions spread across menus and toolbars. This 
       tiny toolbox can be called with Ctrl+M and appears right near 
       the editing cursor position. The interface to manage this toolbox
       is underway, which beside other things, will facilitate to 
       configure it visually as to which icons, at what position:row-col,
       should appear. The goal is to allow users to hide all toolbars from 
       applications window and call this toolbox whenever there is a need.
       A work-in-progress. But the toolbox is functional with Ctrl+M.

  * hbide/projectwizard.prg
  * hbide/projmanager.prg
    + Advanced: "New Project Wizard".

  * hbide/docviewgenerator.ui
    % Refined: the working of slider of tree and view widgets, reported 
      on users-list. The tree pane area was unable to be expanded on 
      the right and hence functions list contents were not visible 
      properly.

  * hbqt/qtcore/hbqt_bind.cpp
    % Optimization leading to proper object destruction on Qt level,
       in certain cases. This optimization has no visible impact, but 
       certainly improves memory consumption in applications which 
       have high rate of creation/destruction cycles.
